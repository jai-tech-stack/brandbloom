# BrandBloom — Project Goal (never forget)

**North star:** [trybloom.ai](https://www.trybloom.ai/) — “Effortlessly create on-brand assets.” We match that experience, then we make it better and best.

## What trybloom.ai does (our benchmark)

1. **Add your website** — Enter URL. Bloom instantly scans the site to understand the brand.
2. **Bloom learns your brand** — AI extracts logos, colors, fonts, and analyzes design aesthetic.
3. **Generate assets** — Create polished, on-brand assets for social, ads, and more in seconds.

**Product pillars:** Create · Edit · Resize · Upload · 4K images.

**Promise:** “Consistently create polished on-brand images.” “Trusted by 10,000+ brands.”

## Our goal

- **Parity first:** Same 3-step process (URL → learn brand → generate). Same quality of extraction (logos, colors, fonts, design aesthetic) and generation (on-brand, high quality). No fake or placeholder brand data.
- **Then better:** Where we can improve (accuracy, speed, UX, pricing, or features), we do. We aim to be the best, not just a copy.

Every feature, fix, and doc should answer: *Does this get us to trybloom-level, or beyond?*

## How TryBloom builds (and how we match)

TryBloom’s pipeline (from research): **(1) Scanning & extraction** — URL → scan site for brand identity markers. **(2) Visual data analysis** — CV/ML to extract logos, color palettes, fonts, and “design aesthetic” so assets match brand style. **(3) Asset generation** — once brand DNA is “cracked,” generative AI produces on-brand social, ads, 4K shots.

We follow the same flow: extract (HTML/CSS + optional AI/backend) → brand data (logos, colors, fonts, tagline, personality/tone) → generate with full context in the prompt. See **`TRYBLOOM_HOW_THEY_BUILD.md`** for the side-by-side mapping.
